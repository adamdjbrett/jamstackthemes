# 11ty Gets Tufte

An 11ty project based on the work of [Edward Tufte](https://edwardtufte.com/). This 11ty project uses [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and [et-book, a web typeface of the font used in Edward Tufte's books](https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book). The failover font is Gil Sans which is also a prefered font of Edward Tufte. Thank you Dave Liepman the creator of `tufte.css` and to all of the contributors to [Tufte-CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css).
